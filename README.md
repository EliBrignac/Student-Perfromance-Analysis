# Student-Perfromance-Analysis

## The Shiny App
To run the app I made using shiny, run the line of code `runGitHub( "Student-Perfromance-Analysis", "EliBrignac")`
in your favorite R compiler IDE. It will pull up a pop-up window in your current browser.


## The General Data
Here are the graphs that the other file makes, I just made them because it was fun and interesting
